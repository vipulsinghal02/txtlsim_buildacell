\chapter{\textsc{Installation}}
	\section{Prerequisites}
	Our toolbox builds upon basic MATLAB\texttrademark  functionality and the Simbiology toolbox. Therefore the presence of Simbiology is essential for our TXTL toolbox to work. The toolbox was tested on MATLAB 2012 for Mac OSX, MATLAB 2010a for Linux and MATLAB 2011b-2012a for Windows. 
	\section{Installing the toolbox}
	\begin{enumerate}
\item Download the toolbox zip archive \textsf{txtl\_0\_42a.tgz} from the project's SourceForge\texttrademark page: \url{http://sourceforge.net/p/txtl/wiki/Home/}
\item Unzip the file into a directory of your choice. In windows, this may take two unzip steps. Ultimately, you should have a folder named txtl\_0\_42a. 
\item Set the MATLAB working directory to the folder txtl\_0\_42a, or a parent folder. 
\item You may either run \begin{verbatim} txtl_init  \end{verbatim} at the
beginning of each MATLAB session or add the directories there to the search path and save. 
\item All done. Try opening and running \textsf{negautoreg.m} in the \textsf{Examples} directory. If this runs without error, you have successfully installed the TXTL modelling toolbox. Congrats!
