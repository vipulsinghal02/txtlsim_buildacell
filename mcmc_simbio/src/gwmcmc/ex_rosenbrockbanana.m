%% The MCMC hammer
%
% GWMCMC is an implementation of the Goodman and Weare 2010 Affine
% invariant ensemble Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler. MCMC sampling
% enables bayesian inference. The problem with many traditional MCMC samplers
% is that they can have slow convergence for badly scaled problems, and that
% it is difficult to optimize the random walk for high-dimensional problems.
% This is where the GW-algorithm really excels as it is affine invariant. It
% can achieve much better convergence on badly scaled problems. It is much
% simpler to get to work straight out of the box, and for that reason it
% truly deserves to be called the MCMC hammer.

%% Rosenbrock: A badly scaled example
%
% A classical difficult low dimensional problem is the rosenbrock density.
% It is defined by the following log-probability function:
%

logPfun=@(m) -(100*(m(2,:)-m(1,:).^2).^2 +(1-m(1,:)).^2)/20;

%lets visualize it:
close all
[X,Y]=meshgrid(-4:.01:6,-1:.02:34);
Z=logPfun([X(:) Y(:)]'); Z=reshape(Z,size(X));
contour(X,Y,exp(Z))
colormap(parula)

%% Apply the MCMC hammer:

% Now we apply the Goodman & Weare MCMC sampler and plot the results on top
%

M=2; %number of model parameters
Nwalkers=40; %number of walkers/chains.
minit=randn(M,Nwalkers);
tic
models=gwmcmc(minit, logPfun,100000,'StepSize',30,'burnin',.2);
toc


%flatten the chain: analyze all the chains as one

models=models(:,:);

%plot the results

hold on
plot(models(1,:),models(2,:),'k.')
